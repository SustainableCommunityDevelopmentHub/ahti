      p Since we all depend upon civil infrastructure, we have a moral responsibility to one another to help ensure that it does not fail. 

      p By definition, umati is inlusive, transparent, efficient, locally relevant, and bridges many aspects of culture, prescedent, and appropriateness.  Our current research emphasis is the assessment of drinking water, wastewater, and municipal solid waste technologies.

      p Umati Portal's primary goal is to assist SCD Hub with the development of its knowledgebase and to assist more people in contrinuting useful information to that project, such that it may help in decision making in community projects.  The SCD Clinic format for appropriate technology discussions can provide a regular hands on learning opportunity for underserved communities.

      h2 Water systems
      p As we learn more about water, we begin to see it as a living resource.  Water issues are complex and challenging.  Watershed planning begs the question.. "Can we increase watershed capacity? ie. re-foresting, erosion reduction, urban plantings, reduction of heat island effects.  Yes we can.
